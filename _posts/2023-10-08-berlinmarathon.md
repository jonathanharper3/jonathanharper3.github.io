This past month, I ran the Berlin marathon. I had previously experienced a lot of frustration with marathons, and my goal entering the race was to not walk. If this seemed attainable, I figured a time goal of 2:30:00 would be a good day for me, and anything below this would be even better. At the end, I ended up achieving both goals and ran 2:27:44. As only a few weeks have passed, I wanted to write a post to help me remember the experience. There have also been a few marathons where friends have run faster than my time, and I’ve begun to feel a little too envious of their times, so I am hopeful that a write-up will help me feel proud of my accomplishment.

Four seconds in, pause for four seconds, four seconds out, pause for four seconds. Repeat until calm.

This was my breathing approximately seven minutes before the start of the Berlin Marathon. I was surrounded on all sides by people and in very close quarters. This was the A corral. Admittedly, I had likely made few friends when I jumped over the corral’s gate and landed within this chaotic blob of runners. But I’m sure it had gone mostly unnoticed. Each person in the mass of people was likely focused on little more than themselves at the moment. We were all seven minutes away from the beginning of an event that we had spent all summer training for and all year thinking of. Four seconds in, pause, four seconds out, pause.

After two or three minutes, my heart rate calmed. I took off the long-sleeved shirt I’d worn from the bag check to the start line and threw it over the fence onto a pile of other clothes that had been brought to discard. This is the custom of a large city marathon. They normally are run in the fall and start when the weather is still cool. At the time, it was around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. This weather is great to run in, but it is miserable to stand around in for any extended period of time, especially in a tank top and shorts. Thus, people bring warm clothes to strip off minutes before the race starts and never see again. I had forgotten about this ritual when packing for my trip and was saying good bye to a shirt that was fairly well liked. The fact that the blob was emitting enough body heat to keep me warm anyway was not left unnoticed as I floated my shirt over the fence and into the discard pile.

With two minutes to go, the race announcer began announcing the fastest of the elite fields. On the woman’s side, he announced last year’s winner and a woman who was two hours and thirteen minutes away from setting a world record, Tigst Assefa. On the men’s side, he announced the great Eliud Kipchoge. I stood on my tiptoes when Kipchoge’s name was announced and saw his hands as he raised them to wave. That would be my only glimpse. 

There was an extended countdown that led to the start of our journey. Getting from my place to the start line was a stressful journey, and I let my friend Connor Mora navigate the crowd while I kept my hand affixed to his shoulder. The road opened up once the running began, and my claustrophobia disappeared almost immediately. There was orange paint on the ground immediately past the start line that had been poured by climate activists. I noticed it briefly when passing and more so when I was picking the paint out of my leg hairs after the race. 

Connor was aiming for a faster time than I was, so I let him go while I tried to settle into a pace that felt comfortable. After a quarter of a mile, I saw him a few rows ahead of me and decided that maybe I would wish him one last good luck. We ran around the Siegessäule together, and then he surged into his own goal pace. I passed one mile in 5:43 and said to myself, “right on schedule.” My legs felt tired but comfortable.

I say my legs felt tired with reason. My activity before the race didn’t necessarily promote the idea of running my best, and I had told myself that I wouldn’t ruin my trip due to a race that wasn’t guaranteed to go well. I arrived into Copenhagen off a red-eye on Wednesday afternoon. I might have slept an hour on that flight, but I can’t really remember when. Upon arrival, I went on a ten mile run around the city to see all of the touristy things I knew I wouldn’t see otherwise. I then subscribed to a bike pass and biked for two hours around the rest of the city. I thought this may have ruined my race, but I managed the rest of the week relatively well and arrived to the start line Sunday morning feeling okay. My legs didn’t feel weightless in the first mile or at any time during the race, but that may have been for the best. 

There aren’t many details from the race that I do remember, in all honesty. I think this is probably a good thing. I’ll note the things I do remember.

My first five kilometers were controlled at my 2:30:00 goal pace, and my legs felt like they could manage that. A guy in a yellow singlet stuck out to me in my pack, and I told myself that I would stay with him for a while. Once this was determined, I lost myself in the crowd. So many people were out cheering, and so I read the signs they had prepared. One had a button that said “push for a turbo boost,” and so I pushed it. I thought that this was a better mentality compared to the alternative, serious approach. We passed a lot of apartment buildings along the route, and I loved looking up to see how many people were spectating the race from their open windows.

I also took water from every stop I could. Before my very first marathon, I called a more experienced friend for advice, and he told me to always take fluid from the water stations. During the Chicago marathon, this meant I was drinking every mile. This was probably too frequent and resulted in me needing to pee midway through. In Berlin, they offered water less frequently at first and then more frequently towards the end of the race. I veered towards the opposite side of the road to grab my first water cup at five kilometers. Normally, drinking water out of a cup isn’t easy while running, but there are tactics to make it easier. Usually, the cups are made of paper or cheap plastic. Pinching the top at the sides to make the intake hole smaller typically is the best route. The five kilometer water cups were hard plastic, which made pinching impossible. Instead, I tried to drink the old-fashioned way and splashed water all over my face. Miserable fail. I spent the next few kilometers strategizing better ways to handle these cups. My game plan was to cover the top of the cup with my palm and leave a small hole on one side that I could drink out of. This would likely result in some splash but less than before. The next water station and all others in the race used regular, cheap plastic cups that could be pinched at the top. My strategizing didn’t actually lead to any implementation, but it was a great way to pass the time.

Around ten miles, I found myself next to the yellow singlet guy. We traded glances and I asked, “What time are we running today?” His English was so-so, but he understood my question after I re-asked it and told me that he was hoping for 2:31:00. I said that sounded good, and also mentioned that I thought we were on pace for something faster than that. He shrugged, and then I shrugged, and then I didn’t see him again for the rest of the race.

It was around this time that I developed a new game plan. My legs felt good enough, and the group I was in was beginning to thin. I saw a big group ahead, and I thought that I could probably catch them. This would require some solo running, which I wasn’t thrilled about. However, I knew that my race was ahead of me, so I pushed a little on my own. There were a few smaller groups of two or three people that had dropped themselves from the larger group, and as I was gaining ground on the large group, I would also pass by these smaller groups. I knew that I could burn myself if I tried to close the gap all at once, so I would stay to chat with these smaller groups along the way. We’d maybe exchange a few words to each other or a fist bump. A guy from London kept me company for a full mile before I looked down at my watch and told him that I was going to keep on moving up. I extended the invitation, but he’d bitten off more than he could chew and was trying to delay an inevitable bonk. Tough.

As it turns out, the big group was trying to run 2:30:00, but they were judging off of the gun time rather than their individual chip time. I caught them at halfway, and we all passed through with the clock as it read 1:15:00. One person said “perfect”, which is how I knew what pace they were aiming for. My watch said 1:14:30, and that’s how I knew that it had taken me thirty seconds to get to the start line. I hadn’t been paying attention to the big clocks at the kilometer marks before then because I didn’t know what kilometer pace I was trying to run. I stayed with the big group for maybe a mile but was feeling some momentum and didn’t want that to go to waste. Back to group hopping.

Around mile fifteen, I saw a guy in front of me with a bib on his back that read “PACE”. I wasn’t sure who he was pacing, but he was cruising through the crowd, and I thought it could be strategic to attach myself to him for a while. It took a small surge to catch up to him, but once I was on his shoulder I wordlessly stayed there. My guess was that he had been pacing an elite woman who had dropped out, and instead of dropping out himself, he was trying to catch up to another elite woman and help her group out. This was confirmed to me by a spectator yelling at him around mile sixteen. They were about fifteen seconds ahead. We were going to make up that fifteen seconds in one mile. Cool.

I remembered at mile seventeen that I had forgotten to take my energy gel. It was in a belt that I had around my stomach and in under my singlet. The zipper for the belt was on my backside, and I spent a clumsy hundred meters fumbling with the zipper trying to get my gel out. I had already taken one gel at mile eight and was scheduled to take another one around mile 22. Maybe I would delay that gel to mile 23 since I was a mile late in taking this one. Luckily, I hadn’t done very much research into gel intake, and so taking it one mile late didn’t phase me very much. In marathons past, I’d taken four gels, or one every six miles. This led to some weird stomach issues that always resulted in me entertaining the idea of puking (or actually puking, in one instance). The most I’d taken in a long run during this training cycle was two, and so I thought that I could add one additional into my marathon and hopefully avoid bonking and puking. It wasn’t an exact science, but running rarely ever is for me.

I stayed with the elite woman and her pacers until mile eighteen and then continued my progress through the field. By this point, my legs were feeling the pace and the distance. They weren’t cramping like they had in previous marathons, and each step made me more confident that I could finish without walking, but I also didn’t want to fall into a mental state where I was thinking about my legs too much. Because of my week, my travel, and my touristing, my legs hadn’t felt great at the beginning of the marathon. They felt worse now, but I didn’t need to admit that. Instead, I told myself that my legs felt bad to begin with. They’d felt tired the whole race. This feeling was normal. I knew this was a lie, but strangely enough, the lie didn’t matter. The thought was out of my head and I focused back on the road and the people in front of me.

The last ten kilometers really are a blur to me. I passed a line of people with exactly 10K to go and gave them an annoying pep talk that was meant more for myself than them. I passed by the Nike pop up shop that had given us a free t-shirt the day before, and I also passed by a billboard that said “Patience gets you there faster” and included a photo of Eliud Kipchoge. I wondered what Kipchoge thought about when he ran past it. My friends Micah and Alanna gave me a little cheer with about two miles to go, and a lot of other people cheered for me by name along the path as well. I’ll talk about this later. Before I knew it, or later than I could’ve hoped for, I was at the Brandenburg Gate and had the finish line in sight. I had been fairly confident up to this point that my race was going well, but it was around this point where it finally hit me that I was going to finish. I was elated! Ecstatic! I tried to kick but had barely any leg power to do so. The finish line felt like it was getting closer and also felt like it was staying the same distance away, but eventually I passed through it and slowed to a very awkward walk. It’s really quite weird to walk after you’ve been running nonstop for 26.2 miles.

I fist bumped a guy with a very Japanese looking name on his bib and grabbed my medal from the volunteer instead of letting them put it around my neck. I avoided the photographers and took a bag filled with food. Connor was along this road talking to some Joe about whatever. Talking to strangers after a race is truly one of the best parts of life. He had run five minutes faster than I had but was fairly annoyed with his performance nonetheless. We grabbed my bag from bag check, dilly-dallied for a while, and then started the slow walk back towards the hotel.

Alanna asked later that day what my favorite part of the marathon was, and I had to think for a moment. Running through the Brandenburg Gate and realizing that the training I’d done through the summer had resulted in a strong race was a really satisfying experience. But the best part was the cheers along the way. Each racing bib had the runner’s name on it. Mine had Jonathan, Connor’s had Connor, the guy I fist-bumped at the end had a Japanese looking name written in English characters. And when I ran past the crowds, I’d hear people cheer “Let’s go Jonathan!” Sometimes they’d say Yonathan since the J makes a ‘yuh’ sound in German. But this made me feel so special! Especially in a city where I knew nobody and in a race where I didn’t really expect very many individualized cheers. It helped that I was running by myself sometimes, but it made me understand why people come to this race and run it year after year. It’s one of a kind, and an experience that I’ll cherish for a long while, time and race execution excluded.

Since Berlin, I’ve tried to run a little and have been so-so with success. My legs feel awful most of the time, but it’s fall in Utah and there’re a lot of trees to go out and look at. I’m not sure what my training will look like in the upcoming months, especially as winter approaches and my motivation inevitably wanes. However, I’m sure that at some point in the upcoming months, I’ll feel the itch to race again and will sign up for something new before too long. If I keep this blog going, I might even write about it, but who’s really to say.

Bye!
